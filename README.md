# SAFE Network Testnet action

This action provides the following functionality:

- Deploying a testnet by deploying the [SAFE Network](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network) node binary to individual Digital Ocean droplets.
- Destroying a previously deployed testnet.

# Usage

This action can be used by including it as a step in a workflow.

```
- name: Launch testnet
  uses: maidsafe/sn_testnet_action@master
  with:
      do-token: ${{ secrets.DO_TOKEN }}
      aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      aws-access-key-secret: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      ssh-secret-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_SECRET_KEY  }}
      node-count: 50
      node-version: 0.27.0
```

We can also use a binary built during the workflow by passing the path to the `node-path` input.
